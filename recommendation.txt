Recommendation to Client

For this Crypto dataset, I do not recommend clustering the data. On the elbow curve, 
there is no clear optimal point at which the inertia drop slows down due to increased clusters. 
If clustering is necessary, I would advise a k value of 7 as this is the most obvious slowing point
on the elbow curve.
